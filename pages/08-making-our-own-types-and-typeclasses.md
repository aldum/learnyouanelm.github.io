Making Our Own Types and Typeclasses
====================================

In the previous chapters, we covered some existing Elm types.
In this chapter, we'll learn how to make our own and how to
put them to work!

Algebraic data types intro
--------------------------

So far, we've run into a lot of data types. `Bool`, `Int`, `Char`, `Maybe`, etc.
But how do we make our own? Well, one way is to use the *type* keyword
to define a type. In the standard library, `Bool` is translated directly
to JavaScript, but let's see how we could define our own `Bool` type.


```elm
type Bool = False | True
```

`type` means that we're defining a new data type. The part before the `=`
denotes the type, which is `Bool`. The parts after the `=` are *value
constructors*. They specify the different values that this type can
have. The `|` is read as *or*. So we can read this as: the `Bool` type can
have a value of `True` or `False`. Both the type name and the value
constructors have to be capital cased.

In a similar fashion, we can think of the `Int` type as being defined like
this:

```elm
type Int = -9007199254740991 | -9007199254740990 | ... | -1 | 0 | 1 | 2 | ... | 9007199254740991
```

![caveman](img/caveman.png)

The first and last value constructors are the minimum and maximum
possible values of `Int`. It's not actually defined like this, the
ellipses are here because we omitted a heapload of numbers, so this is
just for illustrative purposes.

Now, let's think about how we would represent a shape in Elm. One
way would be to use tuples. A circle could be denoted as `(43.1, 55.0,
10.4)` where the first and second fields are the coordinates of the
circle's center and the third field is the radius. Sounds OK, but those
could also represent a 3D vector or anything else. A better solution
would be to make our own type to represent a shape. Let's say that a
shape can be a circle or a rectangle. Here it is:

```elm
type Shape = Circle Float Float Float | Rectangle Float Float Float Float
```

Now what's this? Think of it like this. The `Circle` value constructor has
three fields, which take floats. So when we write a value constructor,
we can optionally add some types after it and those types define the
values it will contain. Here, the first two fields are the coordinates
of its center, the third one its radius. The `Rectangle` value constructor
has four fields which accept floats. The first two are the coordinates
to its upper left corner and the second two are coordinates to its lower
right one.

Now when I say fields, I actually mean parameters. Value constructors
are actually functions that ultimately return a value of a data type.
Let's take a look at the type signatures for these two value
constructors.

```elm
> Circle
<function> : Float -> Float -> Float -> Shape
> Rectangle
<function> : Float -> Float -> Float -> Shape
```

Cool, so value constructors are functions like everything else. Who
would have thought? Let's make a function that takes a shape and returns
its surface.

```elm
surface : Shape -> Float
surface s = case s of
  (Circle _ _ r) -> pi * r ^ 2
  (Rectangle x1 y1 x2 y2) -> (abs <| x2 - x1) * (abs <| y2 - y1)
```

The first notable thing here is the type declaration. It says that the
function takes a shape and returns a float. We couldn't write a type
declaration of `Circle -> Float` because `Circle` is not a type, `Shape` is.
Just like we can't write a function with a type declaration of `True ->
Int`. The next thing we notice here is that we can pattern match against
constructors. We pattern matched against constructors before (all the
time actually) when we pattern matched against values like `"string"` or `False`
or `5`, only those values didn't have any fields. We just write a
constructor and then bind its fields to names. Because we're interested
in the radius, we don't actually care about the first two fields, which
tell us where the circle is.

```elm
> surface <| Circle 10 20 10
314.1592653589793 : Float
> surface <| Rectangle 0 0 100 100
10000 : Float
```

Yay, it works! Value constructors are functions, so we can map them and partially apply
them and everything. If we want a list of concentric circles with
different radii, we can do this.

```elm
> List.map (Circle 10 20) [4,5,6,6]
[Circle 10.0 20.0 4.0,Circle 10.0 20.0 5.0,Circle 10.0 20.0 6.0,Circle 10.0 20.0 6.0] : List Shape
```

Our data type is good, although it could be better. Let's make an
intermediate data type that defines a point in two-dimensional space.
Then we can use that to make our shapes more understandable.

```elm
type Point = Point Float Float
type Shape = Circle Point Float | Rectangle Point Point
```

Notice that when defining a point, we used the same name for the data
type and the value constructor. This has no special meaning, although
it's common to use the same name as the type if there's only one value
constructor. So now the `Circle` has two fields, one is of type `Point` and
the other of type `Float`. This makes it easier to understand what's what.
Same goes for the rectangle. We have to adjust our surface function to
reflect these changes.

```elm
surface : Shape -> Float
surface s = case s of
  (Circle _ r) -> pi * r ^ 2
  (Rectangle (Point x1 y1) (Point x2 y2)) -> (abs <| x2 - x1) * (abs <| y2 - y1)
```

The only thing we had to change were the patterns. We disregarded the
whole point in the circle pattern. In the rectangle pattern, we just
used a nested pattern matching to get the fields of the points. If we
wanted to reference the points themselves for some reason, we could have
used as-patterns.

```elm
> surface (Rectangle (Point 0 0) (Point 100 100))
10000 : Float
> surface (Circle (Point 0 0) 24)
1809.5574 : Float
```

How about a function that nudges a shape? It takes a shape, the amount
to move it on the x axis and the amount to move it on the y axis and
then returns a new shape that has the same dimensions, only it's located
somewhere else.

```elm
nudge : Shape -> Float -> Float -> Shape
nudge s a b = case s of
  (Circle (Point x y) r) -> Circle (Point (x+a) (y+b)) r
  (Rectangle (Point x1 y1) (Point x2 y2)) -> Rectangle (Point (x1+a) (y1+b)) (Point (x2+a) (y2+b))
```

Pretty straightforward. We add the nudge amounts to the points that
denote the position of the shape.

```elm
> nudge (Circle (Point 34 34) 10) 5 10
Circle (Point 39.0 44.0) 10.0 : Shape
```

If we don't want to deal directly with points, we can make some
auxilliary functions that create shapes of some size at the zero
coordinates and then nudge those.

```elm
baseCircle : Float -> Shape
baseCircle r = Circle (Point 0 0) r

baseRect : Float -> Float -> Shape
baseRect width height = Rectangle (Point 0 0) (Point width height)
```

```elm
> nudge (baseRect 40 100) 60 23
Rectangle (Point 60.0 23.0) (Point 100.0 123.0) : Shape
```

You can, of course, export your data types in your modules. To do that,
just write your type along with the functions you are exporting and then
add some parentheses and in them specify the value constructors that you
want to export for it, separated by commas. If you want to export all
the value constructors for a given type, just write `..`

If we wanted to export the functions and types that we defined here in a
module, we could start it off like this:

```elm
module Shapes exposing
    ( Point(..)
    , Shape(..)
    , surface
    , nudge
    , baseCircle
    , baseRect
    )
```

By doing `Shape(..)`, we exported all the value constructors for `Shape`, so
that means that whoever imports our module can make shapes by using the
`Rectangle` and `Circle` value constructors. It's the same as writing `Shape
(Rectangle, Circle)`.

We could also opt not to export any value constructors for `Shape` by just
writing `Shape` in the export statement. That way, someone importing our
module could only make shapes by using the auxilliary functions
`baseCircle` and `baseRect`. `Set` uses that approach. You can't create a
set by doing `Set.Set [(1,2),(3,4)]` because it doesn't export that value
constructor. However, you can make a set by using one of the
auxilliary functions like `Set.fromList`. Remember, value constructors are
just functions that take the fields as parameters and return a value of
some type (like `Shape`) as a result. So when we choose not to export
them, we just prevent the person importing our module from using those
functions, but if some other functions that are exported return a type,
we can use them to make values of our custom data types.

Not exporting the value constructors of a data types makes them more
abstract in such a way that we hide their implementation. Also, whoever
uses our module can't pattern match against the value constructors.

Record syntax
-------------

![record](img/record.png)

OK, we've been tasked with creating a data type that describes a person.
The info that we want to store about that person is: first name, last
name, age, height, phone number, and favorite ice-cream flavor. I don't
know about you, but that's all I ever want to know about a person. Let's
give it a go!

```elm
type Person = Person String String Int Float String String
```

O-kay. The first field is the first name, the second is the last name,
the third is the age and so on. Let's make a person.

```elm
> guy = Person "Buddy" "Finklestein" 43 184.2 "526-2928" "Chocolate"
Person "Buddy" "Finklestein" 43 184.2 "526-2928" "Chocolate" : Person
```

That's kind of cool, although slightly unreadable. What if we want to
create a function to get seperate info from a person? A function that
gets some person's first name, a function that gets some person's last
name, etc. Well, we'd have to define them kind of like this.

```elm
firstName : Person -> String
firstName (Person firstname _ _ _ _ _) = firstname

lastName : Person -> String
lastName (Person _ lastname _ _ _ _) = lastname

age : Person -> Int
age (Person _ _ age _ _ _) = age

height : Person -> Float
height (Person _ _ _ height _ _) = height

phoneNumber : Person -> String
phoneNumber (Person _ _ _ _ number _) = number

flavor : Person -> String
flavor (Person _ _ _ _ _ flavor) = flavor
```

Whew! I certainly did not enjoy writing that! Despite being very
cumbersome and BORING to write, this method works.

```elm
> guy = Person "Buddy" "Finklestein" 43 184.2 "526-2928" "Chocolate"
Person "Buddy" "Finklestein" 43 184.2 "526-2928" "Chocolate" : Person
> firstName guy
"Buddy" : String
> height guy
184.2 : Float
> flavor guy
"Chocolate" : String
```

There must be a better way, you say! Well no, there isn't, sorry.

Just kidding, there is. Hahaha! The makers of Elm were very smart
and anticipated this scenario. They included an alternative way to write
data types. Here's how we could achieve the above functionality with
record syntax.

```elm
type Person = Person { firstName : String
                     , lastName : String
                     , age : Int
                     , height : Float
                     , phoneNumber : String
                     , flavor : String
                     }
```

So instead of just naming the field types one after another and
separating them with spaces, we use curly brackets. First we write the
name of the field, for instance, `firstName` and then we write a
colon `:` and then we specify
the type. The resulting data type is exactly the same. The main benefit
of this is that it creates functions that lookup fields in the data
type. By using record syntax to create this data type, Elm
automatically made these functions: `.firstName`, `.lastName`, `.age`,
`.height`, `.phoneNumber` and `.flavor`.

```elm
> flavor
<function> : { b | flavor : a } -> a
> firstName
<function> : { b | firstName : a } -> a
```

There's another benefit to using record syntax. When we print the
the type, it displays it differently if we use record syntax to define
and instantiate the type. Say we have a type that represents a car. We
want to keep track of the company that made it, the model name and its
year of production. Watch.

```elm
type Car = Car String String Int
```

```elm
> Car "Ford" "Mustang" 1967
Car "Ford" "Mustang" 1967 : Car
```

If we define it using record syntax, we can make a new car like this.

```elm
type Car = Car {company : String, model : String, year : Int}
```

```elm
> Car {company="Ford", model="Mustang", year=1967}
Car { company = "Ford", model = "Mustang", year = 1967 } : Car
```

When making a new car, we don't have to necessarily put the fields in
the proper order, as long as we list all of them. But if we don't use
record syntax, we have to specify them in order.

Use record syntax when a constructor has several fields and it's not
obvious which field is which. If we make a 3D vector data type by doing
`type Vector = Vector Int Int Int`, it's pretty obvious that the fields
are the components of a vector. However, in our Person and Car types, it
wasn't so obvious and we greatly benefited from using record syntax.

Type parameters
---------------

A value constructor can take some values parameters and then produce a
new value. For instance, the `Car` constructor takes three values and
produces a car value. In a similar manner, *type constructors* can take
types as parameters to produce new types. This might sound a bit too
meta at first, but it's not that complicated. If you're familiar with
templates in C++, you'll see some parallels. To get a clear picture of
what type parameters work like in action, let's take a look at how a
type we've already met is implemented.

```elm
type Maybe a = Nothing | Just a
```

![yeti](img/yeti.png)

The `a` here is the type parameter. And because there's a type parameter
involved, we call `Maybe` a type constructor. Depending on what we want
this data type to hold when it's not `Nothing`, this type constructor can
end up producing a type of `Maybe Int`, `Maybe Car`, `Maybe String`, etc. No
value can have a type of just `Maybe`, because that's not a type per se,
it's a type constructor. In order for this to be a real type that a
value can be part of, it has to have all its type parameters filled up.

So if we pass `Char` as the type parameter to `Maybe`, we get a type of
`Maybe Char`. The value `Just 'a'` has a type of `Maybe Char`, for example.

You might not know it, but we used a type that has a type parameter
before we used `Maybe`. That type is the list type. The list type takes
a parameter to produce a concrete type. Values can have a `List Int` type,
a `List Char` type, a `List (List String)` type, but you can't have a value 
that just has a type of `List`.

Let's play around with the `Maybe` type.

```elm
> Just "Haha"
Just "Haha" : Maybe String
> Just 84
Just 84 : Maybe number
> Nothing
Nothing : Maybe a
> Just 10.0
Just 10.0 : Maybe Float
```

Type parameters are useful because we can make different types with them
depending on what kind of types we want contained in our data type. When
we do `Just "Haha"`, the type inference engine figures it out to be of
the type `Maybe String`, because if the `a` in the `Just a` is a string, then
the `a` in `Maybe a` must also be a string.

Notice that the type of `Nothing` is `Maybe a`. Its type is polymorphic. If
some function requires a `Maybe Int` as a parameter, we can give it a
`Nothing`, because a `Nothing` doesn't contain a value anyway and so it
doesn't matter. The `Maybe a` type can act like a `Maybe Int` if it has to,
just like `5` can act like an `Int` or a `Double`. Similarly, the type of the
empty list is `List a`. An empty list can act like a list of anything. That's
why we can do `[1,2,3] ++ []` and `["ha","ha","ha"] ++ []`.

Using type parameters is very beneficial, but only when using them makes
sense. Usually we use them when our data type would work regardless of
the type of the value it then holds inside it, like with our `Maybe a`
type. If our type acts as some kind of box, it's good to use them. We
could change our `Car` data type from this:

```elm
type Car = Car { company : String
               , model : String
               , year : Int
               }
```

To this:

```elm
type Car a b c = Car { company : a
                     , model : b
                     , year : c
                     }
```

But would we really benefit? The answer is: probably no, because we'd
just end up defining functions that only work on the `Car String String
Int` type. For instance, given our first definition of `Car`, we could make
a function that displays the car's properties in a nice little text.

```elm
tellCar : Car -> String
tellCar (Car {company, model, year}) = 
  "This " ++ company ++ " " ++
  model ++ " was made in " ++ toString year
```

```elm
> stang = Car {company="Ford", model="Mustang", year=1967}
Car { company = "Ford", model = "Mustang", year = 1967 } : Car
> tellCar stang
"This Ford Mustang was made in 1967" : String
```

A cute little function! The type declaration is cute and it works
nicely. Now what if `Car` was `Car a b c`?

```elm
tellCar : Car String String a -> String
tellCar (Car {company, model, year}) =
  "This " ++ company ++ " " ++ model ++ " was made in " ++ toString year
```

We'd have to force this function to take a `Car` type of `Car
String String a`. You can see that the type signature is more complicated
and the only benefit we'd actually get would be that we can use any type
as the type for c.

```elm
> tellCar (Car "Ford" "Mustang" 1967)
"This Ford Mustang was made in 1967" : String
> tellCar (Car "Ford" "Mustang" )
"This Ford Mustang was made in \"nineteen sixty seven\"" : String
```

![meekrat](img/meekrat.png)

In real life though, we'd end up using `Car String String Int` most of the
time and so it would seem that parameterizing the `Car` type isn't really
worth it. We usually use type parameters when the type that's contained
inside the data type's various value constructors isn't really that
important for the type to work. A list of stuff is a list of stuff and
it doesn't matter what the type of that stuff is, it can still work. If
we want to sum a list of numbers, we can specify later in the summing
function that we specifically want a list of numbers. Same goes for
`Maybe`. `Maybe` represents an option of either having nothing or having one
of something. It doesn't matter what the type of that something is.

Another example of a parameterized type that we've already met is `Dict k
v`. The `k` is the type of the keys in a dictionary and the `v` is the
type of the values. This is a good example of where type parameters are
very useful. Having dictionaries parameterized enables us to have mappings from
any type to any other type, as long as the type of the key is some comparable
type. If we were defining a mapping type, we could add such a
constraint in the *type* declaration:

```elm
type Dict comparable v = ...
```

However, it's a very strong convention in Elm to *never add
such constraints in data declarations. Why? Well, because we don't
benefit a lot, but we end up writing more class constraints, even when
we don't need them. If we put or don't put the comparable constraint in the
*type* declaration for `Dict k v`, we're going to have to put the
constraint into functions that assume the keys in a dictionary can be ordered.
But if we don't put the constraint in the data declaration, we don't
have to put `comparable` in the type declarations of functions that don't
care whether the keys can be ordered or not. An example of such a
function is `toList`, that just takes a mapping and converts it to an
associative list. Its type signature is `toList : Dict k a -> [(k, a)]`.
If `Dict k v` had a type constraint in its *type* declaration, the type for
toList would have to be toList :  Dict comparable v -> List (comparable, v)`, even
though the function doesn't do any comparing of keys by order.

So don't put type constraints into *type* declarations even if it seems
to make sense, because you'll have to put them into the function type
declarations either way.

Let's implement a 3D vector type and add some operations for it. We'll
be using a parameterized type because even though it will usually
contain numeric types, it will still support several of them.

```elm
type Vector a = Vector a a a

vplus : Vector number -> Vector number -> Vector number
vplus (Vector i j k) (Vector l m n) = Vector (i+l) (j+m) (k+n)

vectMult : Vector number -> number -> Vector number
vectMult (Vector i j k) m = Vector (i*m) (j*m) (k*m)

scalarMult : Vector number -> Vector number -> number
scalarMult (Vector i j k) (Vector l m n) = i*l + j*m + k*n
```

`vplus` is for adding two vectors together. Two vectors are added just by
adding their corresponding components. `scalarMult` is for the scalar
product of two vectors and `vectMult` is for multiplying a vector with a
scalar. These functions can operate on types of `Vector Int`, or 
`Vector Float`, as long as the `a` from `Vector a` is from the
the `number` typeclass. Notice that we didn't put a `number` class constraint in the
*type* declaration, because we'd have to repeat it in the functions
anyway.

Once again, it's very important to distinguish between the type
constructor and the value constructor. When declaring a data type, the
part before the `=` is the type constructor and the constructors after it
(possibly separated by `|`'s) are value constructors. Giving a function a
type of `Vector t t t -> Vector t t t -> t` would be wrong, because we
have to put types in type declaration and the vector *type* constructor
takes only one parameter, whereas the value constructor takes three.
Let's play around with our vectors.

```elm
> vplus (Vector 3 5 8) (Vector 9 2 8)
Vector 12 7 16 : Vector number
> vplus (Vector 3 5 8) (Vector 9 2 8) |> vplus (Vector 0 2 3)
Vector 12 9 19 : Vector number
> vectMult (Vector 3 9 7) 10
Vector 30 90 70 : Vector number
> scalarMult (Vector 4 9 5) (Vector 9.0 2.0 4.0)
74 : Float
> vectMult (Vector 2 9 3) (scalarMult (Vector 4 9 5) (Vector 9 2 4))
Vector 148 666 222 : Vector number
```

Type aliases
-------------

Type aliases are a way to make your type annotations easier to read.
Type aliases don't really do anything per se, they're just
about giving some types different names so that they make more sense to
someone reading our code and documentation. E.g. here's how the standard
library defines `Time` as a synonym for `Float`.

```elm
 type alias Time = Float
```

![chicken](img/chicken.png)

If we make a function that converts a timestamp to an ISO8601 date string
and call it
`toISOString` or something, we can give it a type declaration of
`toISOString : Float -> String` or `toISOString : Time ->
String`. Both of these are essentially the same, only the latter is nicer
to read.

When we were dealing with the `Dict` module, we first represented a
phonebook with an association list before converting it into a dictionary. As
we've already found out, an association list is a list of key-value
pairs. Let's look at a phonebook that we had.

```elm
phoneBook : List (String, String)
phoneBook =
    [("betty","555-2938")
    ,("bonnie","452-2928")
    ,("patsy","493-2928")
    ,("lucille","205-2928")
    ,("wendy","939-8282")
    ,("penny","853-2492")
    ]
```

We see that the type of `phoneBook` is `List (String,String)`. That tells us
that it's an association list that maps from strings to strings, but not
much else. Let's make a type alias to convey some more information in
the type declaration.

```elm
type alias PhoneBook = List (String,String)
```

Now the type declaration for our phonebook can be `phoneBook :
PhoneBook`. Let's make a type alias for String as well.

```elm
type alias PhoneNumber = String
type alias Name = String
type alias PhoneBook = List (Name,PhoneNumber)
```

Giving the `String` type alias is something that Elm programmers do
when they want to convey more information about what strings in their
functions should be used as and what they represent.

So now, when we implement a function that takes a name and a number and
sees if that name and number combination is in our phonebook, we can
give it a very pretty and descriptive type declaration.

```elm
inPhoneBook : Name -> PhoneNumber -> PhoneBook -> Bool
inPhoneBook name pnumber pbook = List.member (name,pnumber) pbook
```

If we decided not to use type aliases, our function would have a type
of `String -> String -> [(String,String)] -> Bool`. In this case, the
type declaration that took advantage of type aliases is easier to
understand. However, you shouldn't go overboard with them. We introduce
type aliases either to describe what some existing type represents in
our functions (and thus our type declarations become better
documentation) or when something has a long-ish type that's repeated a
lot (like `List (String,String)`) but represents something more specific in
the context of our functions.

Type aliases can also be parameterized. If we want a type that
represents an association list type but still want it to be general so
it can use any type as the keys and values, we can do this:

```elm
type alias AssocList comparable v = List (comparable,v)
```

Now, a function that gets the value by a key in an association list can
have a type of `k -> AssocList comparable v -> Maybe v`. `AssocList` is
a type constructor that takes two types and produces a concrete type,
like `AssocList Int String`, for instance.

*Fonzie says:* Aaay! When I talk about *concrete types* I mean like
fully applied types like `Map` `Int` `String` or if we're dealin' with one of
them polymorphic functions, `List a` or `Maybe a` and stuff. And
like, sometimes me and the boys say that `Maybe` is a type, but we don't
mean that, cause every idiot knows `Maybe` is a type constructor. When I
apply an extra type to `Maybe`, like `Maybe String`, then I have a concrete
type. You know, values can only have types that are concrete types! So
in conclusion, live fast, love hard and don't let anybody else use your
comb!

Make sure that you really understand the distinction between type
constructors and value constructors. Just because we made a type alias
called `AssocList` doesn't mean that we can do stuff like
`AssocList [(1,2),(4,5),(7,9)]`. All it means is that we can refer to its
type by using different names. We can do:

```elm
list : AssocList Int Int
list = [(1,2),(3,5),(8,9)]
```

which will make the numbers inside assume a type of
Int, but we can still use that list as we would any normal list that has
pairs of integers inside. Type aliases (and types generally) can only
be used in the type portion of Elm. We're in Elm's type portion
whenever we're defining new types (so in *type* and *type alias* declarations)
or when we're located after a `:`. The `:` is in type declarations or in
type annotations.

Another cool data type that takes two types as its parameters is the
`Either a b` type. This is roughly how it's defined:

```elm
type Result error value = Ok value | Err error
```

It has two value constructors. If the `Ok` is used, then its contents
are of type `value` and if `Err` is used, then its contents are of type `error`.
So we can use this type to encapsulate a value of one type or another and
then when we get a value of type `Result error value`, we usually pattern match on
both `Ok` and `Err` and we do different stuff based on which one of them it
was.

```elm
> Ok 20
Ok 20 : Result error number
> Err "w00t"
Err "w00t" : Result String value
```

So far, we've seen that `Maybe` a was mostly used to represent the results
of computations that could have either failed or not. But somtimes,
`Maybe a` isn't good enough because `Nothing` doesn't really convey much
information other than that something has failed. That's cool for
functions that can fail in only one way or if we're just not interested
in how and why they failed. A `Dict` lookup fails only if the key we
were looking for wasn't in the dictionary, so we know exactly what happened.
However, when we're interested in how some function failed or why, we
usually use the result type of `Result error value`, where `error` is some sort of type
that can tell us something about the possible failure and `value` is the type
of a successful computation. Hence, errors use the `Err` value
constructor while results use `Ok`.

An example: a high-school has lockers so that students have some place
to put their Guns'n'Roses posters. Each locker has a code combination.
When a student wants a new locker, they tell the locker supervisor which
locker number they want and he gives them the code. However, if someone
is already using that locker, he can't tell them the code for the locker
and they have to pick a different one. We'll use a dictionary from `Dict` to
represent the lockers. It'll map from locker numbers to a pair of
whether the locker is in use or not and the locker code.

```elm
import Dict

type LockerState = Taken | Free

type alias Code = String

type alias LockerMap = Dict.Dict Int (LockerState, Code)
```

Simple stuff. We introduce a new data type to represent whether a locker
is taken or free and we make a type synonym for the locker code. We also
make a type synonym for the type that maps from integers to pairs of
locker state and code. And now, we're going to make a function that
searches for the code in a locker dictionary. We're going to use an Either
String Code type to represent our result, because our lookup can fail in
two ways — the locker can be taken, in which case we can't tell the code
or the locker number might not exist at all. If the lookup fails, we're
just going to use a String to tell what's happened.

```elm
lockerLookup : Int -> LockerMap -> Result String Code
lockerLookup lockerNumber dict =
    case Dict.get lockerNumber dict of
        Nothing -> Err <| "Locker number " ++ toString lockerNumber ++ " doesn't exist!"
        Just (state, code) -> if state /= Taken
                                then Ok code
                                else Err <| "Locker " ++ toString lockerNumber ++ " is already taken!"
```

We do a normal lookup in the dictionary. If we get a `Nothing`, we return a value
of type `Err String`, saying that the locker doesn't exist at all. If we
do find it, then we do an additional check to see if the locker is
taken. If it is, return an `Err` saying that it's already taken. If it
isn't, then return a value of type `Ok Code`, in which we give the
student the correct code for the locker. It's actually an `Ok String`,
but we introduced that type alias to introduce some additional
documentation into the type declaration. Here's an example dictionary:

```elm
lockers : LockerMap
lockers = Dict.fromList
    [(100,(Taken,"ZD39I"))
    ,(101,(Free,"JAH3I"))
    ,(103,(Free,"IQSA9"))
    ,(105,(Free,"QOTSA"))
    ,(109,(Taken,"893JJ"))
    ,(110,(Taken,"99292"))
    ]
```

Now let's try looking up some locker codes.

```elm
> lockerLookup 101 lockers
Ok "JAH3I" : Result String Code
> lockerLookup 100 lockers
Err "Locker 100 is already taken!" : Result String Code
> lockerLookup 102 lockers
Err "Locker number 102 doesn't exist!" : Result String Code
> lockerLookup 110 lockers
Err "Locker 110 is already taken!" : Result String Code
> lockerLookup 105 lockers
Ok "QOTSA" : Result String Code
```

We could have used a `Maybe a` to represent the result but then we
wouldn't know why we couldn't get the code. But now, we have information
about the failure in our result type.

Recursive data structures
-------------------------

![the fonz](img/thefonz.png)

As we've seen, a constructor in an algebraic data type can have several
(or none at all) fields and each field must be of some concrete type.
With that in mind, we can make types whose constructors have fields that
are of the same type! Using that, we can create recursive data types,
where one value of some type contains values of that type, which in turn
contain more values of the same type and so on.

Think about this list: `[5]`. That's just syntactic sugar for `5::[]`. On the
left side of the `::`, there's a value and on the right side, there's a
list. And in this case, it's an empty list. Now how about the list
`[4,5]`? Well, that desugars to `4::(5::[])`. Looking at the first `::`, we see
that it also has an element on its left side and a list `(5::[])` on its
right side. Same goes for a list like `3::(4::(5::6::[]))`, which could be
written either like that or like `3::4::5::6::[]` (because `::` is
right-associative) or `[3,4,5,6]`.

We could say that a list can be an empty list or it can be an element
joined together with a `::` with another list (that can be either the empty
list or not).

Let's use algebraic data types to implement our own list then!

```elm
type List a = Empty | Cons a (List a)
```

This reads just like our definition of lists from one of the previous
paragraphs. It's either an empty list or a combination of a head with
some value and a list. If you're confused about this, you might find it
easier to understand in record syntax.

```elm
type List a = Empty | Cons { listHead : a, listTail : List a}
```

You might also be confused about the Cons constructor here. *cons* is
another word for `::`. You see, in lists, `::` is actually a constructor that
takes a value and another list and returns a list. We can already use
our new list type! In other words, it has two fields. One field is of
the type of `a` and the other is of the type `List a`.

```elm
> Empty
Empty : List a
> Cons 5 Empty
Cons 5 Empty : List number
> Cons 4 (Cons 5 Empty)
Cons 4 (Cons 5 Empty) : List number
> Cons 3 (Cons 4 (Cons 5 Empty))
Cons 3 (Cons 4 (Cons 5 Empty)) : List number
```

Let's make a function that adds two of our lists together. This is how
++ is defined for normal lists:

```elm
(+++) : List a -> List a -> List a
(+++) ls rs = case ls of
    [] -> rs
    (x::xs) -> x :: (xs +++ rs)
    
infixr 5 +++
```

First off, we notice a new syntactic construct, the fixity declarations.
We can define functions to be automatically infix by making them
comprised of only special characters. (In the example above, we made our own
operator `+++` instead of trying to redefine the existing `++`, because 
elm only allows fixity to be set once).
When we define functions as operators, we can use that to give them a
fixity (but we don't have to). A fixity states how tightly the operator
binds and whether it's left-associative or right-associative. For
instance, `*`'s fixity is `infixl 7 *` and `+`'s fixity is `infixl 6`. That
means that they're both left-associative `(4 * 3 * 2 == (4 * 3) * 2)`
but `*` binds tighter than `+`, because it has a greater fixity, so
`5 * 4 + 3 == (5 * 4) + 3`.

So we'll just steal that for our own list. We'll name the function `.++`.

```elm
(.++) : List a -> List a -> List a
(.++) ls rs = case ls of
    Empty -> rs
    Cons x xs -> Cons x (xs .++ rs)

infixr 5 .++
```

And let's see if it works ...

```elm
> a = Cons 3 (Cons 4 (Cons 5 Empty))
Cons 3 (Cons 4 (Cons 5 Empty)) : List number
> b = Cons 6 (Cons 7 Empty)
b = Cons 6 (Cons 7 Empty) : List number
> a .++ b
Cons 3 (Cons 4 (Cons 5 (Cons 6 (Cons 7 Empty)))) : List number
```

Nice. Is nice. If we wanted, we could implement all of the functions
that operate on lists on our own list type.

![binary search tree](img/binarytree.png)

Now, we're going to implement a *binary search tree*. If you're not
familiar with binary search trees from languages like C, here's what
they are: an element points to two elements, one on its left and one on
its right. The element to the left is smaller, the element to the right
is bigger. Each of those elements can also point to two elements (or
one, or none). In effect, each element has up to two sub-trees. And a
cool thing about binary search trees is that we know that all the
elements at the left sub-tree of, say, 5 are going to be smaller than 5.
Elements in its right sub-tree are going to be bigger. So if we need to
find if 8 is in our tree, we'd start at 5 and then because 8 is greater
than 5, we'd go right. We're now at 7 and because 8 is greater than 7,
we go right again. And we've found our element in three hops! Now if
this were a normal list (or a tree, but really unbalanced), it would
take us seven hops instead of three to see if 8 is in there.

Sets and dictionaries (i.e. `Set` and `Dict`) are implemented using trees,
only instead of normal binary search trees, they use balanced binary
search trees, which are always balanced. But right now, we'll just be
implementing normal binary search trees.

Here's what we're going to say: a tree is either an empty tree or it's
an element that contains some value and two trees. Sounds like a perfect
fit for an algebraic data type!

```elm
type Tree a = EmptyTree | Node a (Tree a) (Tree a)
```

Okay, good, this is good. Instead of manually building a tree, we're
going to make a function that takes a tree and an element and inserts an
element. We do this by comparing the value we want to insert to the root
node and then if it's smaller, we go left, if it's larger, we go right.
We do the same for every subsequent node until we reach an empty tree.
Once we've reached an empty tree, we just insert a node with that value
instead of the empty tree.

In languages like C, we'd do this by modifying the pointers and values
inside the tree. In Elm, we can't really modify our tree, so we have
to make a new sub-tree each time we decide to go left or right and in
the end the insertion function returns a completely new tree, because
Elm doesn't really have a concept of pointer, just values. Hence,
the type for our insertion function is going to be something like `a ->
Tree a - > Tree a`. It takes an element and a tree and returns a new
tree that has that element inside.

So, here are two functions. One is a utility function for making a
singleton tree (a tree with just one node) and a function to insert an
element into a tree.

```elm
singleton : a -> Tree a
singleton x = Node x EmptyTree EmptyTree

treeInsert : comparable -> Tree comparable -> Tree comparable
treeInsert x t = case t of
    EmptyTree -> singleton x
    (Node a left right) ->
         if x == a then Node x left right
         else if x < a then Node a (treeInsert x left) right
         else Node a left (treeInsert x right)
```

The `singleton` function is just a shortcut for making a node that has
something and then two empty sub-trees. In the insertion function, we
first have the edge condition as a pattern. If we've reached an empty
sub-tree, that means we're where we want and instead of the empty tree,
we put a singleton tree with our element. If we're not inserting into an
empty tree, then we have to check some things. First off, if the element
we're inserting is equal to the root element, just return a tree that's
the same. If it's smaller, return a tree that has the same root value,
the same right sub-tree but instead of its left sub-tree, put a tree
that has our value inserted into it. Same (but the other way around)
goes if our value is bigger than the root element.

Next up, we're going to make a function that checks if some element is
in the tree. First, let's define the edge condition. If we're looking
for an element in an empty tree, then it's certainly not there. Okay.
Notice how this is the same as the edge condition when searching for
elements in lists. If we're looking for an element in an empty list,
it's not there. Anyway, if we're not looking for an element in an empty
tree, then we check some things. If the element in the root node is what
we're looking for, great! If it's not, what then? Well, we can take
advantage of knowing that all the left elements are smaller than the
root node. So if the element we're looking for is smaller than the root
node, check to see if it's in the left sub-tree. If it's bigger, check
to see if it's in the right sub-tree.

```elm
treeElem : comparable -> Tree comparable -> Bool
treeElem x t = case t of
    EmptyTree -> False
    (Node a left right) ->
    if x == a then True
    else if x < a then treeElem x left
    else treeElem x right
```

All we had to do was write up the previous paragraph in code. Let's have
some fun with our trees! Instead of manually building one (although we
could), we'll use a fold to build up a tree from a list. Remember,
pretty much everything that traverses a list one by one and then returns
some sort of value can be implemented with a fold! We're going to start
with the empty tree and then approach a list from the right and just
insert element after element into our accumulator tree.

```elm
> nums = [8,6,4,1,7,3,5]
[8,6,4,1,7,3,5] : List number
> numsTree = List.foldr treeInsert EmptyTree nums
Node 5 (Node 3 (Node 1 EmptyTree EmptyTree) (Node 4 EmptyTree EmptyTree)) (Node 7 (Node 6 EmptyTree EmptyTree) (Node 8 EmptyTree EmptyTree)) : Tree number
```

In that `foldr`, `treeInsert` was the folding function (it takes a tree and
a list element and produces a new tree) and `EmptyTree` was the starting
accumulator. `nums`, of course, was the list we were folding over.

When we print our tree to the console, it's not very readable, but if we
try, we can make out its structure. We see that the root node is 5 and
then it has two sub-trees, one of which has the root node of 3 and the
other a 7, etc.

```elm
> treeElem 8 numsTree
True : Bool
> treeElem 100 numsTree
False : Bool
> treeElem 1 numsTree
True : Bool
> treeElem 10 numsTree
False : Bool
```

Checking for membership also works nicely. Cool.

So as you can see, algebraic data structures are a really cool and
powerful concept in Elm. We can use them to make anything from
boolean values and weekday enumerations to binary search trees and more!
